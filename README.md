Snake Game is considered to be a skillful game and has popularized among people for generations. The snake in the Snake game is controlled using the four direction buttons relative to the direction it is headed in. The playerâ€™s objective in the game is to achieve maximum points as possible by collecting food or fruits. The player loses once the snake hits the wall or hits itself.

I have used Pygame to create this snake game. Pygame is an open-source library that is designed for making video games. It has inbuilt graphics and sounds libraries. It is also beginner-friendly, and cross-platform

pip install pygame

Step 1: Firstly we are importing the necessary libraries
Step 2: After importing libraries we need to initialize Pygame using pygame.init() method. 
Step 3: Initialize snake position and its size.
Step 4: Create a function to display the score of the player. 
Step 5: Now create a game over function that will represent the score after the snake is hit by a wall or itself. 
Step 6: Now we will be creating our main function

Finally program is implementedðŸ˜Š
